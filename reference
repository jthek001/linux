The first of the commands below starts the program abcd in the background in such a way that the subsequent logout does not stop it.
# nohup abcd &
# exit


Note that these methods prevent the process from being sent a 'stop' signal on logout, but if input/output is being received for these 
standard I/O files (stdin, stdout, or stderr), they will still hang the terminal.[1] See Overcoming hanging, below.

nohup is often used in combination with the nice command to run processes on a lower priority.
# nohup nice abcd &
